# Meta-analysis

# The main assessment for one of my master's modules - Eco-evolutionary Responses to Anthropogenic Climate Change - was a meta-analysis.
# This involved picking a question to be answered by conducting a meta-analysis ourselves.
# My question was "Does Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) have an effect on the blood melatonin levels of birds?"
# Here is the code I created to run my meta-analysis. I discovered that ALAN significantly increased night-time blood melatonin concentrations in birds.
